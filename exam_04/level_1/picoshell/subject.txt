Assignment name:	picoshell
Expected files:		picoshell.c
Allowed functions:	close, fork, wait, exit, execvp, dup2, pipe


Write the following functions:

int	picoshell(char **cmds[]);


The goal of this function is to execute a pipeline. 
It must execute each command of cmds and connect the output of one to the input of the next command.

Cmds contains a null-terminated list of valid commands. 
Each row of cmds is an argv array directly usable by execvp.
The first argument of each command is the command name or path and can be passed directly as the first argument of execvp.

If any error occurs, the function must return 1.
It must not leave any fd open.
If it works properly, it must wait all child processes and return 0.
There's a main.c file in this directory, which contains a program to test the function.


Examples:
./picoshell /bin/ls "|" /usr/bin/grep picoshell
picoshell
./picoshell echo 'squalala' "|" cat "|" sed 's/a/b/g'
squblblb
