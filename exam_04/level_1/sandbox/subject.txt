Assignment name:	sandbox
Expected files:		sandbox.c
Allowed functions:	fork, waitpid, exit, alarm, sigaction, kill, printf, strsignal, errno, sigaddset, sigemptyset, sigfillset, sigdelset, sigismember


Write the following function:

#include <stdbool.h>
int	sandbox(void (*f)(void), unsigned int timeout, bool verbose);


This function must test if the function 'f' is a <nice> or <bad> function. 
It will return 1 if 'f' is <nice>. 
It will return 0 if 'f' is <bad>. 
It will return -1 if, during execution of <f>, an error occurs.

A function is considered <bad> if any of the following occurs:

- It is terminated by a signal
  - The process is killed and removed from the system
  - SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGINT, SIGQUIT
- It is stopped by a signal
  - The process is paused but still exists in memory
  - SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN
- It exits with an exit code that is not 0
- It times out


If 'verbose' is true, it must write the appropiate message among the following:

"Nice function!\n"
"Bad function: exited with code <exit_code>\n"
"Bad function: <signal_description>\n"
"Bad function: timed out after <timeout> seconds\n"


It must not leak processes. 
Even in zombie state, which will be checked using wait.

The code will be tested with very bad functions.
