Assignment name:	argo
Expected files:		argo.c
Allowed functions:	getc, ungetc, printf, malloc, calloc, realloc, free, isdigit, fscanf, write


Write a function 'argo' that will parse a JSON file in the structure declared in argo.h:

int	argo(json *dst, FILE *stream);

- "dst" is the pointer to the AST to be created
- "stream" is the file to parse


The function will return 1 for success, -1 for failure.
If an unexpected token is found, it will print the following message in stdout:

"Unexpected token '%c'\n"

If the unexpected token is EOF, it will print instead:

"Unexpected end of input\n"


Only handle numbers, strings, and maps.
Numbers will only be basic ints like in scanf("%d").
Handle escaping in the strings only for backslashes and quotation marks:

- "\\"
- "\'"
- "\""

Don't handle spaces, consider them as invalid tokens.


In case of doubt how to parse JSON, read RFC8259.
Tested with the main, the output should be the same as the input, except for errors.
There are some functions in given.c that might be of help.


Examples:

echo -n '"bonjour"' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
"bonjour"$

echo -n '"escape! \" "' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
"escape! \" "$

echo -n '{"tomatoes":42,"potatoes":234}' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
{"tomatoes":42,"potatoes":234}$

echo -n '{"recursion":{"recursion":{"recursion":{"recursion":"recursion"}}}}' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
{"recursion":{"recursion":{"recursion":{"recursion":"recursion"}}}}$

echo -n '"unfinished string' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
unexpected end of input$

echo -n '"unfinished string 2\"' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
unexpected end of input$

echo -n '{"no value?":}' | ./argo /dev/stdin | cat -e
unexpected token '}'$
