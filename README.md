# Exams of 42

## Project Overview

This project is going to be a mix of programs and notes that I've been developing to help me study for exams of 42. I'm storing it here mainly for organizational purposes, but it's public in case some wandering soul is willing to take a look. Simple as that, no more documentation will be provided since this project is for personal use.
